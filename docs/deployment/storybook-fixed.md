# Storybook Setup Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

All syntax errors have been resolved. Here's what was fixed:

## Issues Found & Fixed

1. **Missing React imports**: Added `import React from 'react'` to all story files
2. **Wrong file extension**: Changed `preview.ts` to `preview.tsx` (contains JSX)
3. **Missing dependency**: Added `class-variance-authority` to package.json
4. **Path aliases**: Configured webpack to handle `@/` imports in Storybook

## Next Steps

1. **Install the missing dependency**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/brandonarmstrong/Documents/Github/RoRTrader
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Storybook**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   npm run storybook
   ```

3. **Visit**: http://localhost:6006
