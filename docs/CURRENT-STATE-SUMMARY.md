# üö® RoR Trader - Current State Summary

## What's Built But NOT Connected

### Frontend (Session 10)
‚úÖ **UI Components Created:**
- TradingViewChart - Shows charts with indicators
- StrategyBuilderCanvas - Drag-and-drop strategy builder
- IndicatorPalette - Select from 11 indicators
- StrategyTemplateSelector - Choose pre-built strategies
- Performance widgets - Show strategy metrics

**Status: Using MOCK DATA - Not connected to backend!**

### Backend (Session 11)
‚úÖ **APIs Created:**
- `/api/analysis/*` - Calculate indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger)
- `/api/strategies/*` - Save/load strategies
- Database schema for strategies
- Redis caching for performance

**Status: WORKING but frontend doesn't call these APIs!**

## The Missing Link

### ‚ùå What Needs to Be Done:
1. **Create service layer** in frontend to call backend APIs
2. **Replace mock data** in components with real API calls
3. **Wire up save/load** functionality in strategy builder
4. **Connect charts** to real market data
5. **Add authentication** flow between frontend/backend

## Quick Test

```bash
# Backend is working - test it:
curl http://localhost:3001/api/analysis/indicators

# Frontend shows UI but with fake data:
# Visit http://localhost:3000/demo/strategy
```

## Next Steps

1. Read `/docs/transitions/ror-trader-integration-plan.md`
2. Create API service layer in frontend
3. Connect one component at a time
4. Test each integration point

**The impressive UI and powerful backend exist - they just need to be connected!**
